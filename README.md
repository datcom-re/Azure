# Azure
An user left from my organization and I removed from all groups and disabled that user and moved to 'Disabled users' OU. Also, set the attribute value for set msexchhidefromaddresslists = TRUE. He was using an Office 365 license. We don't delete accounts but we revoke licences.
Please note we are using MS 2016 STD Server in my organization and Office 365.
Now, my problem is the left user is still showing in the office 365 admin center (As unlicensed user).
msexchhidefromaddresslists = TRUE not working/syncing for Office 365 address book.
